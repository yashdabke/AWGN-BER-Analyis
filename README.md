This MATLAB code simulates a communication system to perform Bit Error Rate (BER) analysis for different modulation schemes (BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM) in the presence of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel impairments

1. Simulation Parameters:
   - `numBits`: The number of bits to be transmitted.
   - `SNRdB`: A range of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values in decibels.
   - `SNR`: Conversion of SNR values from dB to linear scale.
   - `modulationSchemes`: A cell array containing the names of modulation schemes.
   - `numModulations`: The number of modulation schemes being considered.
   - `numSNR`: The number of SNR values being considered.

2. Looping Through Modulation Schemes and SNR Values:
   The code iterates through each modulation scheme and each SNR value to perform simulations for different scenarios.

3. Bit Generation and Modulation:
   For each simulation scenario, random bits are generated. Depending on the modulation scheme being simulated (BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM), the bits are modulated to create a modulated signal.

4. AWGN Channel Simulation:
   The modulated signal is passed through an AWGN channel, introducing random Gaussian noise to simulate real-world channel impairments.

5. Demodulation and BER Calculation:
   The received signal (noisy signal) is demodulated based on the modulation scheme used. For example, for BPSK, a simple threshold is used to demodulate the signal. For QPSK and 16-QAM, the in-phase and quadrature components are checked to determine the received symbols.
   
   The Bit Error Rate (BER) is then calculated by comparing the original transmitted bits with the demodulated bits, counting the number of bit errors.

6. Plotting BER Curves:
   The calculated BER values for each modulation scheme and SNR value are plotted on a logarithmic scale using `semilogy`. This helps visualize how the BER changes with varying SNR for different modulation schemes.

The goal of the code is to analyze and compare the performance of different modulation schemes in terms of their Bit Error Rate under different levels of noise (SNR values). It allows you to observe how the choice of modulation affects the system's robustness against noise and how BER changes as SNR increases or decreases.
